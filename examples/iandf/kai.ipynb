    "\n",
    "We note that many trials of the modelled neuron will produce the exact same spiking pattern, once the resistance and capacitance remain constant. The real neuron, on the other hand, shows some variablity among trials. The article notes that the neuron responds reliably to constant current input with regards to spike count or average firing rate, but, there is volatility in the precise timing of the firings. We are not be able to observe this variance with our model, as the behaviour is deterministic. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, in this implementation of the IandF model, we manually reset the voltage of the neuron to its resting potential immediately after a spike. Looking at the graph from the article, this does not appear to be the behaviour of the real neuron, as we can see a curve downwards following each curve (as opposed to a jump). \n",
    "\n",
    "The article notes that even though precisely timed spiking patterns over multiple trials were produced, only some theories of information processing actually require this behaviour. In other words, we are unsure of the physiological significance of precise spike timings. As such, this difference does not indicate a \"bad\" model. The disagreement between our model and the real neuron may be important, but it also may not affect the study at all. In my opinion, the IandF model seems to provide an accurate look at the behaviour of a neuron. It is a simple starting point that illustrates fundamental concepts well, though it may not be suitable for every study. "
