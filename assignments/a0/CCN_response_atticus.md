Despite sharing a common goal (to understand the computational principles
underlying complex behaviour), the fields of cognitive science, artificial
intelligence, and neuroscience has historically been very disparate in
terminologies and frameworks. So to my understanding, the aim of the Cognitive
Computational Neuroscience (CCN) conference is to promote collaboration and
cross-pollination of ideas between these fields-- which may eventually even
lead to the creation of a new field entirely.


I may be a computer science major, but to be quite honest, I have a strong 
interest in all of these fields, with no particular preferences. When I enrolled 
at UW, I chose this degree only because I thought it would be my best bet for 
taking the courses I wanted in computer science, psychology, and philosophy,
without sacrificing term flexibility, from a bureaucratic standpoint. Still, it
often takes a bit of extra effort to enrol in higher level courses in different
faculties, learn more about the applications in the intersection between these
fields, and meet others similar interests on campus. So, the existence of the
CCN makes me hopeful that there might someday be a separate degree or field that
makes it easier to do all of these things, and I'm super excited to be taking an
interdisciplinary course like PSYCH 420.
