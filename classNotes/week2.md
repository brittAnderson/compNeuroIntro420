# Week 2 Notes

## Breakout Rooms #1

Be able to draw one and explain:
1. What are the axes?
    - X axes is time, Y axis is voltage (millivolts).
    - Resting potential is -70mV. Actional potential -55mV.
    - All or nothing 
    - Depolarization -> +40mV
2. What ion causes the upward deflection?
    - Sodium comes into the neuron, repolarization potassium out.
    - Sodium-Potassium pump.
3. What causes the repolarization?
    - Potassium ions leaving the neuron.
4. Who discovered the action potential?
    - Julius Bernstein with the help of Emil du Bois-Reymond. [Reference](https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/0166-2236(83)90078-4)
5. Who won the Nobel Prize for characterizing the ionic events of the action potential experimentally and building a mathematical model?
    - Did you draw this? https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=44114666
    - Alan Hodgkin.
    - Andrew Huxley.

## Breakout Rooms #2
1. Write a formula that would allow you to compute the error (or how far
   off you were).
    - Start off with a guess. Say guess=11.
    - Come up with an error function. P(x) = abs(Y - guess^2)
    - So if Y = 128, and guess is 11, **P(11) = abs(128 - 11^2) = 7**

2. How much should you adjust your guess to get closer to the correct
   answer?
    - Since this is a computer, you can't have 0.
    - 

3. What is the derivative of $x^2$? Does it have a place in your
   formula?
